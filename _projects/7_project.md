**Problem Statement** <br>The task comprised of 2 teams competing against each other, each with 2 robots - Pass Robot(PR) and Try Robot(TR).
<br> The robots had to perform certain operations in a given sequence to earn points -
<br>     <u>Pick and place</u> : PR to pick a rugby ball from stand, pass it to TR, TR then places it in the try zone
<br>     <u> Place and Kick</u> : Place the rugby ball on a Tee(Kicking stand in rugby) in one of the 3 kicking zones and kick the ball through upper portion of the H shaped goal post
<br><br>
Here's one of our practice sessions showing the problem in action <br>

__Competition Results__<br>
Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the competition was not held physically but virtually, where each team had to submit working videos of robots completing problem statements in a given time. <br>
We finished 3rd nationally among 105 teams in total.
